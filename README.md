### Description

Fully Functional Napster Client. Added/Fixed a few things since last version. read Fix.txt..

added Teknap/Irc Coloring see colors in related\Colors.txt . after you load the client i recommend sharing at least some files(mp3 only) then after loading. you need to either file/connect or 2 click a server to connect. If you cant get any d/l's to start it has nothing to do with INap but the system itself(not as many people as kazaa / direct connect). but chat system works pretty good.. and supports scripting.. ive writen a few games. look for examples at www.intradream.com later and if youd like an install www.intradream.com/INap.msi
